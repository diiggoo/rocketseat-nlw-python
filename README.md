<h1>NLW PYTHON - BARCODE CREATOR</h1>

Description <p>
The execution of this project was made from RocketSeat NLW course. <p>

This project aims to create barcodes dynamically using Python. It utilizes Flask for creating a virtual server and send HTTP requests, Python-Barcode for generating barcodes, and other supporting libraries like Pytest for unit tests, Pylint for formatting, Cerberus for validations, and virtual environment (venv) for development and testing purposes. <p>

Generate barcodes dynamically based on user input. <br>
Web interface for easy interaction. <br>
Support for different barcode formats. <br>
Unit testing with Pytest. <br>
Code quality assurance with Pylint. <br>
Data validation using Cerberus. <br> <p>
